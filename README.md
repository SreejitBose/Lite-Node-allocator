# Lite-Node-allocator
A simple script to generate host file for IITK csews cluster which can be used in MPICH applications.

## Usage

```python
python3 lna.py <number of nodes> <number of cores per node>
```
## Output
The script creates a file named "host_file" which can be used in MPICH applications at time of execution of the binary, like below.
```bash
mpiexec â€“n <number of processes> -f host_file ./<binaryfile>
